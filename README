These python script are written to get top 10 fields of any log file
script 1 uses subprocess, which is ok to use for small log file.. wrote it just to compare..
script 2 uses python dictionary and can handle large log files.

Scripts can be easily tweaked (using regex) to obtain any repeating parameters in the log file
